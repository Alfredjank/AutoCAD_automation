AUTOMATED AUTOCAD POLYLINE VERTICES COORDINATION APPLICATION

To application work properly follow these easy steps:

1. Open dwg file.
2. Make sure that after pressing "Connect to AutoCAD" button printed message shows your desired dwg file name.
3. Make sure that polylines that you want to be coordinated layer name is '310_1proj' or '310_4proj'.
4. Make sure that in the dwg file there already is coordinate block that you desire to insert in all polylines vertices. Also make sure that that coordinate block layer name is 'koordinates'.
5. Every time that you want to use application start it from over.
